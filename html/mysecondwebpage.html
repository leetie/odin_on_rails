<p> this web site is about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
and <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
<p>So i asked a feller about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know about as much about quotations
    as I do about pigeons</q>
    Luckily, I found html dog and it said:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/indtermediate/text/">
    <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone 
        often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.
